                            <p>An Information System (IS) is an integrated set of components for collecting, storing, processing, and disseminating information. It includes hardware, software, data, procedures, and people. The primary purpose of an IS is to support decision-making, coordination, control, analysis, and visualization in an organization. Information systems transform raw data into useful information through a series of activities: input, processing, output, and feedback. They are not just technological artifacts but also encompass the organizational and human dimensions that interact with the technology.</p>
